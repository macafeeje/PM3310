PM3310 ROM ver0.1g release notes;

Replaces stock ROM's D403 & D407, original Philips partnumbers 99214 & 99251. 
Scopes came with D403 in 16k or 32k EEPROM's, however only the upper 16k is accessible. 
With exception of D407, which is 32k and only present on scopes with a IEC bus interface card A14. 

Modifications:
	Continous Roll Mode
		Before modification; the roll capture mode would fill each STOx memory in turn before filling the ACCUmulator and stopping. 
		To restart sampling, the operator must press CLEAR then the RUN key which repeats the process. 
		Because of this, the roll mode becomes quite frustrating to use as you are constantly resetting it. 
		
    After modifiation; by selecting the ROLL and RECURR keys at the same time, the continous roll mod is activated. 
		Sampling will continue indefinitly until the ROLL key is pressed (which physically disengages the RECURR key) and the ACCUmulator is immediatley stored to the STOx memory. 
		The scope will now continue as per the original roll mode described above. 
	
	Software 10x Probe
		Before modification; an original Philips 10x probe had a special ring around the BNC connector which indicated to the scope that a 10x probe was being used. 
		The PM3310 would switch automatically the V/DIV displays and AMPL/DIV displays to apply a 10x correction factor. 
		Such probes are somewhat rare these days, and expensive if in good condition with all attaching parts. 
		
		After modification; By turning the desired A or B channel's CAL knob out of CAL and back into CAL, in software the 10x correction as described above will be applied. 
		This selection will be preserved in RAM after the scope is powered off and on (if the internal RAM batteries are installed and charged) for ease of use with 10x probes. 
	
	Splash Screen
		Before modification; the alphanumeric displays displayed a filled display as a "lamp test". 
		
		After modification; a purely cosmetic right to left fade in of the text "| PM |3310| ;) |" along with the modified ROM version # in the TRIGGER DIV display. 
	
	EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
		Before modification; the alphanumeric displays flash "|EEEE|EEEE|EEEE|EEEE|" on shutdown. This annoyed me. 
		
		After modification; the alphanumeric displays are blanked on shutdown, for a more pleasing experience.
